  <p><img src="images/snowCap.jpg" alt="Captain America" width="200" height="200"><b>Captain America</b> is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. 
  Created by cartoonists Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Captain America Comics #1 (cover 
  dated March 1941) from Timely Comics, a predecessor of Marvel Comics. Captain America was designed as a patriotic 
  supersoldier who often fought the Axis powers of World War II and was Timely Comics' most popular character during 
  the wartime period. The popularity of superheroes waned following the war and the Captain America comic book was 
  discontinued in 1950, with a short-lived revival in 1953. Since Marvel Comics revived the character in 1964, Captain 
  America has remained in publication.

Captain America wears a costume that bears an American flag motif, and is armed with a nearly indestructible shield 
that he throws at foes. The character is usually depicted as the alter ego of Steve Rogers, a frail young man enhanced 
to the peak of human perfection by an experimental serum to aid the United States government's imminent efforts in World 
War II. Near the end of the war, he was trapped in ice and survived in suspended animation until he was revived in the present 
day. Although Captain America often struggles to maintain his ideals as a man out of his time with its modern realities, he 
remains a highly respected figure in his community which includes becoming the long-time leader of the Avengers.

Captain America was the first Marvel Comics character to have appeared in media outside comics with the release of the 1944 
movie serial, Captain America. Since then, the character has been featured in other films and television series, more recently 
in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) portrayed by Chris Evans in Captain America: The First Avenger, The Avengers, Captain 
America: The Winter Soldier, Avengers: Age of Ultron, and the upcoming film Captain America: Civil War.

  <p><img src="images/tonyIron.jpg" alt="Captain America"><b>Iron Man (Tony Stark)</b> is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, as 
  well as its associated media. The character was created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, 
  and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby. He made his first appearance in Tales of Suspense #39 (cover dated March 1963).

An American billionaire playboy, business magnate, and ingenious engineer, Tony Stark suffers a severe chest injury during a 
kidnapping in which his captors attempt to force him to build a weapon of mass destruction. He instead creates a powered suit of 
armor to save his life and escape captivity. Later, Stark augments his suit with weapons and other technological devices he designed 
through his company, Stark Industries. He uses the suit and successive versions to protect the world as Iron Man, while at first 
concealing his true identity. Initially, Iron Man was a vehicle for Stan Lee to explore Cold War themes, particularly the role of 
American technology and business in the fight against communism.[1] Subsequent re-imaginings of Iron Man have transitioned from Cold 
War themes to contemporary concerns, such as corporate crime and terrorism.[1]

Throughout most of the character's publication history, Iron Man has been a founding member of the superhero team the Avengers and has 
been featured in several incarnations of his own various comic book series. Iron Man has been adapted for several animated TV shows and 
films. The character is portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. in the live action film Iron Man (2008), which was a critical and box office success. 
Downey, who received much acclaim for his performance, reprised the role in a cameo in The Incredible Hulk (2008), two Iron Man sequels Iron 
Man 2 (2010) and Iron Man 3 (2013), The Avengers (2012) and Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), and will do so again in Captain America: Civil War 
(2016), Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and both parts of Avengers: Infinity War (2018/2019) in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>
