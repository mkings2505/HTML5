<b>Golden Age</b><br><br>
In 1940, writer Joe Simon conceived the idea for Captain America and made a sketch of the character in costume. "I wrote 
the name 'Super American' at the bottom of the page," Simon said in his autobiography, and then considered:<br><br>

No, it didn't work. There were too many "Supers" around. "Captain America" had a good sound to it. There weren't a lot 
of captains in comics. It was as easy as that. The boy companion was simply named Bucky, after my friend Bucky Pierson, 
a star on our high school basketball team.<br><br>

Simon recalled in his autobiography that Timely Comics publisher Martin Goodman gave him the go-ahead and directed that 
a Captain America solo comic book series be published as soon as possible. Needing to fill a full comic with primarily one 
character's stories, Simon did not believe that his regular creative partner, artist Jack Kirby, could handle the workload alone:<br><br>

I didn't have a lot of objections to putting a crew on the first issue ... There were two young artists from Connecticut 
that had made a strong impression on me. Al Avison and Al Gabriele often worked together and were quite successful in adapting 
their individual styles to each other. Actually, their work was not too far from [that of] Kirby's. If they worked on it, and if 
one inker tied the three styles together, I believed the final product would emerge as quite uniform. The two Als were eager to 
join in on the new Captain America book, but Jack Kirby was visibly upset. "You're still number one, Jack," I assured him. "It's 
just a matter of a quick deadline for the first issue."<br><br>

"I'll make the deadline," Jack promised. "I'll pencil it [all] myself and make the deadline." I hadn't expected this kind of 
reaction ... but I acceded to Kirby's wishes and, it turned out, was lucky that I did. There might have been two Als, but there 
was only one Jack Kirby ... I wrote the first Captain America book with penciled lettering right on the drawing boards, with very 
rough sketches for figures and backgrounds. Kirby did his thing, building the muscular anatomy, adding ideas and pepping up the 
action as only he could. Then he tightened up the pencilled drawings, adding detailed backgrounds, faces and figures.<br><br>
